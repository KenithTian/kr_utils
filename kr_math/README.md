# kr_math

**kr_math** is a collection of template math utilities for use with ROS applications. Example applications include (but are not limited to):

* Vision
* State estimation
* Control

This library is a work in progress. It is intended to complement (but not
replace) heftier libraries like [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org),
[Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) or [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) by providing a collection of
convenient functions and structures. **kr_math** uses Eigen wherever matrix or geometric vector structures are required.
